This is a game about an Android eating apples. It was created for a contest run by the computing dept. at my university.

The rules were as follows:

* I had to use `graphics.py` for the graphics.
* I was not allowed to write my own classes (I presume because we were yet to be taught this, so they wanted to keep it fair)
* I was not allowed to use non-standard modules such as `pygame`
* This means only Python 3 standard modules could be used
* The game had to either be about a bat and ball, or an Android eating apples (I went with the latter)

To run the game, run from main.py
